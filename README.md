# Classical Shadows: PP Scout → MPS Sniper

## Why This Problem Matters

**Entanglement entropy** quantifies genuine quantum correlations but requires exponentially many measurements via full tomography. **Classical Shadows** (Huang et al., 2020) reduce this to $O(\log n / \varepsilon^2)$ samples — but you still need to choose *which subsystem* to measure.

This showcase uses Maestro's **Pauli Propagator as a scout** to cheaply identify where entanglement concentrates on the lattice, then deploys the **MPS backend as a sniper** — running the expensive classical shadows protocol only on the most promising subsystem.

## Code Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `helpers.py` | Reusable functions: `Config` dataclass, circuit builders, scout, shadow estimation, plotting |
| `mipt_classical_shadows.py` | Showcase script: PP Scout (Act 1) → MPS Sniper (Acts 2–6) |

## The Six Acts

### Act 1: PP Scout — Scanning the Lattice

**Backend:** `PauliPropagator` · **Cost:** O(n·d), no wavefunction

Builds a **Clifford approximation** of the TFIM (replacing `Rz(θ)` → `S` gate) and computes `⟨Z_i Z_j⟩` for every nearest-neighbor bond. The pair with the strongest correlation is in the most entangled region.

**Why PP:** The Pauli Propagator works in the Heisenberg picture — tracking operators backward through the circuit. Under Clifford conjugation, a Pauli maps to exactly one other Pauli (no branching), so the cost is $O(n \cdot d)$ regardless of system size. A statevector would need $2^n$ amplitudes. PP scans all bonds in milliseconds.

**Output:** `HOT` subsystem (strongest `|⟨ZZ⟩|`) and `COLD` subsystem (weakest) for comparison.

### Act 2: The Breaking Point — T-Gate Magic

**Backend:** `MatrixProductState`

Injects T-gates into the TFIM circuit. Each T-gate causes Pauli branching ($T^\dagger X T = (X+Y)/\sqrt{2}$), making PP exponentially expensive. Maestro switches to MPS (Schrödinger picture).

**Why MPS:** After $k$ T-gates, PP would need to track $2^k$ Pauli terms. MPS simulates the full state explicitly, with cost controlled by bond dimension $\chi$.

---

### Act 3: Adaptive Bond Dimension (CPU → GPU)

**Backend:** MPS with $\chi_{\text{low}} \to \chi_{\text{high}}$

Time-evolves the TFIM, upgrading $\chi$ when entanglement exceeds a threshold. With `--gpu`, the high-bond stage uses GPU-accelerated tensor contractions.

**Why adaptive $\chi$:** Tensor contraction costs $O(\chi^3)$. Starting at $\chi=16$ and upgrading to $\chi=64$ only when needed avoids 64× overhead during early time steps.

---

### Act 4: Random Clifford Layer

**Backend:** Classical (O(1) per qubit)

Applies random single-qubit Cliffords for tomographic completeness. The inverse channel $U_i^\dagger Z U_i$ is computed classically via Pauli propagation — the Heisenberg picture returns as a classical subroutine.

---

### Act 5: Bitstring Sampling

**Backend:** MPS `execute(shots=N)`

Switches from deterministic `estimate()` to stochastic `execute()`, emulating quantum hardware readout. MPS samples bitstrings efficiently via sequential conditional probabilities.

---

### Act 6: MPS Sniper — Hot vs Cold Comparison

**Backend:** MPS + NumPy post-processing

Runs the full classical shadows protocol on **both** the PP-scouted hot subsystem and the cold subsystem. Side-by-side comparison validates whether the scout correctly identified the entanglement hotspot.

**At 36 qubits:** Exact ED is impossible ($2^{36}$ amplitudes). Classical shadows use 200 snapshots vs $4^{36} \approx 4.7 \times 10^{21}$ full tomography measurements — a $10^{19}\times$ speedup.

## Usage

```bash
# Default: 6×6 = 36 qubits (designed for GPU workstation)
python mipt_classical_shadows.py

# GPU acceleration
python mipt_classical_shadows.py --gpu

# Quick test: 4×4 = 16 qubits + exact ED (~2 min)
python mipt_classical_shadows.py --small
```

## Output

- **`energy_evolution.png`** — $E(t)$ with backend handoff annotated
- **`entanglement_growth.png`** — S₂ comparison: PP-scouted hot vs cold subsystem, with exact ED reference (when ≤20 qubits)
